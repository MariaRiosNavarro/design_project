            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

                <h3>Start with asking why</h3>
                <p>
                  You will start seeing things differently and coming up with
                  more effective ways of achieving goals.

                <p>
                  By looking at problems from a different perspective, your
                  ideas will be fresher and more valuable.

                <p>
                  Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand
                  the frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

                <h3>Share and show your work</h3>
                <p>
                  As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
                  finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept
                  feedback and learn from it.
